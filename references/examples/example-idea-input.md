## Input Format Guidelines

### Optimal Input Structure
```
[Product/Problem Title]

[2-3 sentence summary of the core concept]

### Things to Avoid

❌ **Too Vague**
```
"Make an app for fitness"
```

❌ **Too Technical Without Context**
```
"Build a microservices architecture using Kubernetes with GraphQL APIs and Redis caching"
```

❌ **Feature Lists Without Purpose**
```
"App needs login, notifications, payments, search, chat, analytics, admin dashboard"
```

✅ **Good Example**
```
"Fitness app that helps busy professionals maintain workout consistency by providing 15-minute AI-personalized routines that adapt to available equipment and fitness level, targeting the 68% of gym members who struggle with routine adherence"
```

## Stakeholder Specification Examples

### Simple Stakeholder List
```
Stakeholders: Product, Engineering, Design, Marketing
```

### Detailed Stakeholder Context
```
Stakeholders:
- Product Management (feature prioritization and roadmap)
- Engineering (technical implementation and architecture)
- Security (data protection and compliance)
- Legal (terms of service and privacy policies)
- Customer Support (user onboarding and issue resolution)
- Business Development (partnership and integration opportunities)
```

## Input Length Guidelines

- **Minimum**: 50 words (basic idea description)
- **Optimal**: 200-500 words (provides context without overwhelming)
- **Maximum**: 10,000 characters (system limit for security)

## Security Considerations for Input

### Safe to Include
- General business concepts
- Public market information
- Common technical terms
- General user personas

### Should be Excluded
- Proprietary algorithms or trade secrets
- Specific customer names or contracts
- Internal financial information
- Existing product roadmaps
- Competitive intelligence details

## Input Validation

The skill automatically validates inputs for:
- Length limits (10,000 characters maximum)
- Content filtering (removes potential PII or sensitive data)
- Format validation (ensures readable text)
- Language detection (supports English primarily)
