# Example PRD Output

## Document Information

- **Generated**: 2025-02-11T10:30:00Z
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Security Level**: High
- **Validation**: Completed

## Executive Summary

This document demonstrates the output of the secure idea-to-PRD generation process for a task management application. The system follows security-first design principles with comprehensive validation and sanitization throughout the process.

## Problem Statement

Based on secure input validation and analysis, the system addresses the following needs:
- Team productivity optimization through task organization
- Secure collaboration with role-based access control
- Integration with existing development workflows
- Performance monitoring and analytics

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Task Management**: Create, assign, and track tasks with security controls
2. **Team Collaboration**: Secure messaging and file sharing
3. **Project Organization**: Hierarchical project structure with access controls
4. **Reporting**: Analytics dashboard with data protection
5. **Integration**: API connectivity with authentication

### Security Requirements
- Multi-factor authentication for all users
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security assessments

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 500ms
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime availability

## Technical Architecture

### System Design
- **Architecture Pattern**: Microservices with API Gateway
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens

### Security Implementation
- **Input Validation**: All inputs sanitized and validated
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries only
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy and output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting and DDoS protection

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (2 weeks)
- Authentication and authorization system
- Basic task CRUD operations
- Security framework implementation

### Phase 2: Collaboration Features (3 weeks)
- Team management functionality
- Real-time messaging with security
- File upload with malware scanning

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3 weeks)
- Analytics and reporting
- API integrations with security
- Mobile responsive design

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (2 weeks)
- Production environment setup
- Security hardening and penetration testing
- Performance optimization and monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
- **Data Breach**: Prevented through encryption and access controls
- **Unauthorized Access**: Mitigated with MFA and RBAC
- **Injection Attacks**: Prevented through input validation
- **Session Hijacking**: Mitigated with secure session management

### Compliance Requirements
- GDPR compliance for data protection
- SOC 2 Type II security standards
- Regular security audits and assessments

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**: All features implemented and tested
2. **Security**: Zero high-severity vulnerabilities
3. **Performance**: All benchmarks met or exceeded
4. **Quality**: 95%+ code coverage with comprehensive testing
5. **User Experience**: Positive feedback from beta testing
